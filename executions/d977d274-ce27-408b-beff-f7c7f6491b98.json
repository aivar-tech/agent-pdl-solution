The win rate increased from 0.42 on May 1st to 0.53 on May 30th. The average score also improved from 1250 to 1600 in the same period. The learning curve data shows a decrease in both training and validation loss from epoch 1 to 100, indicating successful learning. The agent consistently outperformed the baseline, with the gap widening over time (1250 vs 1200 on May 1st, increasing to 1600 vs 1350 by May 30th).\",\n        \"confidence\": 85,\n        \"additional_data_needed\": \"A longer time series of performance data would be helpful to confirm the trend. Additionally, data on the agent's performance against a wider variety of opponents and in different game scenarios would strengthen the evaluation.\"\n    },\n    \"hypothesis_2\": {\n        \"status\": \"supported\",\n        \"evidence\": \"Games with more sections generally show higher engagement metrics. For example, G002 with 10 sections has 8000 daily active users and a 3600-second average session length, compared to G001 with 5 sections having 5000 daily active users and a 1800-second average session length. The retention rate also correlates positively with the number of sections, with G002 (10 sections) having a 0.75 30-day retention rate compared to G001 (5 sections) with 0.65. Monetization metrics also show a positive correlation, with G002 having higher average revenue per user (5.0) compared to G001 (2.5).\",\n        \"confidence\": 80,\n        \"additional_data_needed\": \"Data from a larger number of games with varying section counts would provide more robust evidence. Additionally, user feedback specifically addressing the impact of multiple sections on their engagement would be valuable.\"\n    },\n    \"hypothesis_3\": {\n        \"status\": \"insufficient evidence\",\n        \"evidence\": \"The provided data does not include information about a leaderboard system or its impact on player motivation and tournament participation frequency. While we have some engagement metrics, we cannot directly attribute these to a leaderboard system.\",\n        \"confidence\": 90,\n        \"additional_data_needed\": \"Data comparing player participation rates and frequency between tournaments with and without leaderboards. Metrics on the number of tournaments played per user before and after leaderboard implementation would be crucial.\"\n    },\n    \"hypothesis_4\": {\n        \"status\": \"insufficient evidence\",\n        \"evidence\": \"The sample data does not contain information about 'Turbo' tournament formats or comparisons between different tournament durations.
