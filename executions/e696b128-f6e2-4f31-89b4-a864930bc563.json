Without the actual data to evaluate, I cannot provide a meaningful assessment of the hypotheses or generate the JSON response you requested.\n\nTo properly evaluate these hypotheses, I would need detailed information about user engagement metrics, retention rates, participation data, and other relevant statistics from the gametech platform. This data would typically include things like:\n\n- Daily and weekly active user counts\n- User engagement metrics broken down by weekdays vs weekends\n- Retention rates for different tournament formats\n- Participation rates for various tournament types and schedules\n- User activity patterns throughout the day/week\n- Results from any A/B tests or surveys related to tournament formats\n\nWithout this concrete data to analyze, I can't make evidence-based judgments about whether the hypotheses are supported, contradicted, or lack sufficient evidence. I also can't provide specific evidence, assign confidence scores, or suggest additional data needs without a baseline of information to work from.\n\nIf you can provide the actual data analysis for the gametech platform, I'd be happy to evaluate the hypotheses against that information and generate the structured JSON response you requested."
