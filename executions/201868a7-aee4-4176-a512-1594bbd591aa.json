To address this, we need to develop an automated system that analyzes user behavior to identify those at high risk of churning. The system will then create and launch dynamic tournament formats tailored to these users, offering targeted rewards to encourage their continued engagement. This proactive approach aims to retain valuable users and maintain a healthy, active player base.",
